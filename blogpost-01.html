            <h2>Learing to Dive in Aqaba, Jordan</h2>
            <p>I sudenly found myself with a week off while working in Jordan.
                After a bit of research I booked myself on the 4 hour bus journey from Amman to Aqaba and signed up for
                a Padi diving course at a local diving school. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The next morning I turned up for my first lesson. No need for the pool work here.
                After a thorough briefing it was straight into the red sea for my first ever dive.
                There was so much to see. Like diving in a huge tropical aquarium. I was hooked.
